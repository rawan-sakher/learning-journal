# Summary
### A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system.
### a command is always the first thing you type.
### also there must be a space between the command and the first command line argument.
# the basics of moving around the system:
 1. pwd : It tells you what your current or present working directory is, or to verify where we currently are.
 1. Is : what is there.
 1. cd : In order to move around in the system , which stands for change directory.
# There are 2 types of paths we can use :
* Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory.
* Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system.
# important concepts :
* file obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
* ls -a List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
* Everything is actually a file under Linux.
* Linux is an extensionless system.
(Files can have any extension they like or none at all.)
* Linux is case sensitive.
