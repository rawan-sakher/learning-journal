# Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.
# A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.
# A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure.
# Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.
* Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — 
* Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources to allow one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.
# Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files
# Files in Git can reside in three main states: 
1. Committed
Data is securely stored in a local database

1. Modified
File has been changed but not committed to the database

1. Staged
Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot
